# Puzzle-Panel
"Puzzle Panel is one of Yoshi's minigames in Super Mario 64 DS and a Puzzle minigame in New Super Mario Bros. It is based on the game Lights Out. 
The minigame's music is the same theme used in Mix-a-Mug in Super Mario 64 DS, whereas the music used in New Super Mario Bros. is the theme from Lethal Lava Land and Shifting Sand Land instead."
